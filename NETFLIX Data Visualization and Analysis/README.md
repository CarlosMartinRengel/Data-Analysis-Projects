-  As we move forward in time, the frequency of movie additions increases until it peaks in 2019, with 1424 additions. From this year onwards, it starts to decrease.
Notable peaks are also observed in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, indicating a significant increase compared to previous years, this may be due to the rise in popularity of the Netflix platform.
